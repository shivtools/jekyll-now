Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my site. My name is Shiv Toolsidass and I work as a software engineer on the Bikes & Scooters team @ Lyft. Previously, I used to work on data infrastructure at Lyft and storage systems at Box. 

I love learning about how to build highly performant systems, data platforms and products that are intuitive and easy to use. 

My other passions include cooking, running, movies and podcasts. I enjoy mentoring folks, so feel free to reach out with any questions!
